# mathy

For when approximate answers are good enough!

## What it does
Math, just with a little bit of random error in every calculation.

## How to use

Just `import mathy`. Then use mathy functions just like you would the math class.

For example, if you want something close to the square root of two, just type `mathy.sqrt(2)`.

And as an added bonus, importing mathy also messes up the default math class. Therefore, `math.sqrt(2)` will be slightly wrong too.

## But why did you do this?!!!
